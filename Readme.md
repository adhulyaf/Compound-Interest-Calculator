## Compound Interest Calculator – Java

A simple and beginner-friendly **Java console application** that calculates the **future value of an investment** using the **compound interest formula**.

This project helps understand Java basics such as:
- User input (`Scanner`)
- Variables & data types
- Mathematical operations
- `Math.pow()` function
- Output formatting with `printf()`

##  Features
Takes input for:
  - Principal Amount
  - Annual Interest Rate
  - Number of times interest is compounded per year
  - Number of years
Applies the standard compound interest formula
Displays the final amount with two-decimal precision
Clean and simple console-based output

## Formula Used
Amount = Principal [ 1 + Rate \ TimeCompounded ] TimeCompounded * years 

Where:
  **P** = Principal amount
  **r** = Annual interest rate (decimal form)
  **n** = Times interest is compounded per year
  **t** = Number of years
  **A** = Final amount

## Sample Output
Enter the principal amount: 5000
Enter the annual interest rate (in %): 5
Enter the number of times interest is compounded per year: 4
Enter the number of years the money is invested for: 3
The amount after 3 years is: 5796.37
